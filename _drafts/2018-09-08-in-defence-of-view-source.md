title: "In defence of view source"

Ever late to the web discussion party, I read CSS Tricks’ hardline stance on <i>View Source</i>, where Chris argues he’d be happy to get rid of it because you can glean more technical info from dev tools.

This is true. However, I think <i>View Source</i> offers a glimpse into the document author’s mind; what they consider important, what they’re good at, what they’re not good at, even their “ethics” (assuming the bastard hasn't inlined and minified everything, although even this suggests a certain level of technical competence and a desire to make things fast):

{% include figure.html url="skinny-minified.png" alt="The source code from the Skinny Guardian website" caption="Skinny Guardian, inlined and minified" %}

This is not information you'll get quite as readily from dev tools, which focuses on the page's technical foundations rather than the way it's been authored.
