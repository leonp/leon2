[I am a poor psephologist](/posts/ge2017/). [I predicted remain would win the 2016 EU referendum 61-39](/posts/farage-dream/). That poor.

My blog is 11 years old. In that time, I’ve seen four general elections, three of which I’d class as disastrous, one a surprisingly close loss. The next one will be the biggest disaster of all.

Yes, I am a poor psephologist, but I think I’m right on this one.

So, here’s my prediction:

The Tories will win with a majority of 70-odd seats. If you want an actual figure, I’ll give you 78.

Why? Well, if you break it down into push and pull, there is a huge push to Tory factor and *lots* to pull votes from Labour.

## Push to Tories

One major factor, really. Brexit fatigue. Boris Johnson’s whole get a deal, die in a ditch by October 31 schtick was smart. At a bonfire night event last night I heard several people making the oh-so-smart comment about getting a new Guy Fawkes. Every news bulletin over the last few months has been framed around Johnson getting his deal done. The BBC describes this as the Brexit election. One issue to vote on: Getting Brexit done, which Boris Johnson owns.

## Pull from Labour

Lots here.

The main one is the Lib Dems, who have decided their best chance to pick up seats is from dissatisfied Labour voters, rather than “moderate” Tories. I think Jeremy Corbyn has done the right thing by refusing to participate in a culture war of Brexiteers vs. Remainers, and revoking Article 50 is a patently ridiculous policy that only a party with no chance of governing would put forward. But I’ve been on a rally protesting Boris Johnson’s proroguing of parliament and heard what self-identifying “remainers” think of Jeremy Corbyn’s “betrayal”: they won’t vote Labour in seats like Cambridge.

People don’t want reason or nuance in a war. Labour’s supposedly byzantine Brexit policy is in fact perfectly clear and strikes me – someone who voted remain and would vote remain again every time – as the only way to proceed. You can’t simply *ignore* the 2016 referendum result, however ill-informed and damaging it was; if we do leave, then it has to be on the least damaging terms.

The final pull factor I see is Jeremy Corbyn will have lost the surprise element he had in the 2017 election. Inevitably, two years of Brexit wrangling have pulled him into the political mire; he’s seen as part of the general political problem, even if he does shift the debate from Brexit.

So, this will be a traditional election in one way. Swing seats (such as Ipswich) will decide the outcome. Voters will go to the party that best represents their feelings on Brexit. This will mainly benefit the Tories, but the Lib Dems will make some gains too. I don’t buy the idea that great swathes of the north will vote for Johnson, or that the Brexit party will have any significant impact on the result.

## Publishing this after the election

I’m writing this on November 2, 40 days before polling day. I want to be wrong, and have a no doubt irrational fear that any prediction can affect the outcome, regardless of how few people read it. However, I may publish this afterwards; it’ll be interesting to compare what actually happens to how we’re casting the runes at the moment. Hopefully you can all laugh at my pessimism (or even, God forbid, my optimism).
