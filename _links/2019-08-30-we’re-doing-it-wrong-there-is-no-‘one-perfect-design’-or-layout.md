Not sure this is right; at least, it's not right for me. The problem with most reading from a screen isn't the sameness, but simple, poor typograpy: scratchy fonts, small text, lack of contrast, fixed elements... and too much stuff on the screen. Whenever I reach for [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) I want to create a single column.
