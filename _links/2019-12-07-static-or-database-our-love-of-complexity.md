Of course, static sites are <i>de rigeur</i> these days, and the comments get a bit confused over CMSs and databases. But the point is right, I think, and it’s worth considering the original attraction of static, which is based on the belief(?) that 90% of websites don’t _need_ any interactivity. Design defensively for interactivity for a faster, greener and better web.
