_Designing for yourself (and maybe a few others)_ â€” for when you're using a system font ([probably the right thing to do in most cases](http://mrmrs.cc/writing/2016/03/17/webfonts/)). It doesn't _have_ to be the system default ([San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_(sans-serif_typeface)) if you're on a Mac, probably [Segoe UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe#Segoe_UI) on Windows) if the user has installed other fonts on their machine. Like minded souls will currently see [Plex Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Plex) or [Source Sans Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Sans_Pro) ahead of San Francisco.
