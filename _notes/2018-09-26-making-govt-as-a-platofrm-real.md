This is very good (via [@adrianshort](https://mobile.twitter.com/adrianshort)) on how recreating offline government online isn't bold enough (bearing in mind just how good the UK's Government Digital Service is):

<blockquote><p>It’s all online now – well, most of it – but you [the user] still need to understand the structure, and processes, and ways of thinking of government to even make a start. You have to adapt yourself to the bureaucracy. To have your simple need met, you are expected to understand the mess of silos into which government has fragmented. And our focus for most of our time at GDS was digitising that. Digitising bloated paper-based processes, and turning them into pixels. <cite><a href="https://public.digital/2018/09/25/making-government-as-a-platform-real/">Making government as a platform real</a></cite> – Tom Loosemore.</p></blockquote>
