(Dons marketing hat.) Perhaps Labour's got itself in a position post-austerity, post-Brexit, post-whatever where it can talk about a grand <i>rebuilding</i> project. For example: <i>Let&apos;s rebuild Britain!</i>, <i>Rebuild Britain!</i> are powerful, easy to understand slogans. In this story, there's lots of purposeful work to be done (no more skivers and strivers or immigrants as a burden bullshit), Britain can overcome its past (whether that's austerity or even EU membership, if you're appealing to your Brexit-voting constituency) and there's hope for the future etc. It's a good story, maybe, with echoes of 1945 and the NHS – an idea that appeared to serve the Leave campaign so well. — I think you could market this idea well. But are there enough willing listeners?
