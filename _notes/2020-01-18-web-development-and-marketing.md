Quick thoughts on this.

- An organisational structure where marketing departments are handing over edicts for the front-enders to implement is broken. Ghosts of the print world.
- Possible solution is to make marketing and web dev part of the same department (hullo Digital and Marketing). Discussions over things like tracking scripts would involve front-end considerations from the start, so we avoid this kind of problem in the first place.
- Front end is a part of your brand and marketing. <q><a href="https://ia.net/topics/the-interface-of-a-cheeseburger">The interface is the brand</a></q>.
