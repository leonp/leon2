> ... web performance will suffer if you don't say no to the marketing department because you'll suddenly find yourself with eighteen different analytics scripts on your website. <cite><a href="https://css-tricks.com/no-absolutely-not/">No, Absolutely Not</a></cite>

Quick thoughts on this.

- An organisational structure where marketing departments are handing over edicts for the front-enders to implement is broken. Ghosts of the print world.
- Possible solution is to make marketing and web dev part of the same department (hullo Digital and Marketing). Discussions over things like tracking scripts would involve front-end considerations from the start, thereby avoiding this kind of problem.
- Any job where you’re having to say “no” a lot means there’s a problem somewhere. OK I think if a technology/way of working/structure is new, but not long term.
- Front end is a part of your brand and marketing. <q><a href="https://ia.net/topics/the-interface-of-a-cheeseburger">The interface is the brand</a></q>.
