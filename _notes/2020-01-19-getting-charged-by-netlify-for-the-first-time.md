So, I got my first Netlify build minutes bill for $7, probably because I've been caning this site over the weekend with loads of little tweaks. I like to push little and often, but it doesn't matter if I add 1000 pages or fix a single typo: A build's a build is a build, and takes around a minute.

I may as well make use of the 500 additional build mins, on top of the 300 I get for free. That _should_ cover me easily, but I've had to stop my automated [Skinny Guardian](https://www.skinnyguardian.xyz) builds, which makes me sad, and Skinny Guardian next to useless.

Doesn't feel right, to me. What if a build takes ages? I think I'd rather pay a flat, monthly rate for a generous allowance where I don't have to think about it. All pushing me to some trad, LAMP stack hosting.
