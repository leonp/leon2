<blockquote><p>One way to put it is that <cite>New Puritan</cite>, like many of the best Fall songs, isn't content to say something, it must also <em>be</em> something, and what it says and what it is maintain a somewhat dizzying running commentary on one another. <cite><a href="http://annotatedfall.doomby.com/pages/the-annotated-lyrics/new-puritan.html">The Annotated Lyrics</a></cite></p></blockquote>

This is true of The Fall, more so than any other band, I think. Mark always said he wasn't a poet; the songs are meaningless when not heard _as_ songs. Similarly, they resist genre â€” this saying and being are completely self-contained, an expression of Mark's world, even if the building blocks are recognisably rockabilly, avant garde, minimalist, Lovecraft, Philip K Dick, Batman or whatever.
