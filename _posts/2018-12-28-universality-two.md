There's been a twitter storm brewing over Labour MP Kate Osamor and the fact she lives in a council house. Depressingly, <cite>The Mirror</cite> [reported this unsympathetically](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-mp-kate-osamor-not-13777590), citing the normal bullshit about "rich" people making way for people more in need.

Public services need to be used by everyone in order to remain strong. It's no coincidence that the sole benefit that government more or less keeps its hands off is child benefit, which is claimed by all parents, regardless of their income.
