Occasionally, I like to play amateur politics sleuth and, as they say, follow the money. I can claim some success in this. Back in 2015 I got The Guardian to change this story about [Labour voters deserting the party forever after the 2015 election](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/18/labour-party-voters-desertion-election) because of a leftward shift so it acknowledged the people behind the "research". It turned out they weren't entirely disinterested observers, or even researchers, for that matter. They were in fact former Tony Blair advisors.
