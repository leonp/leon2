Occasionally, I like to play amateur politics sleuth and, as they say, follow the money. I can claim some success in this. Back in 2015 I got The Guardian to change this story about [Labour voters deserting the party forever after the 2015 election because of a leftward shift](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/18/labour-party-voters-desertion-election) so it acknowledged the people behind the "research". It turned out they weren't entirely disinterested observers, or even researchers, for that matter. They were in fact former Tony Blair advisors.

<cite>The Observer</cite> is an overtly centrist publication, actively pushing for a change in the Labour party. Where The Guardian more or less objectively reports on politics and publishes a broad range of left-leaning columnists, The Observer sticks to its roster of New Labour giants, including Andrew Rawnsley, Will Hutton, Nick Cohen and Toby Helm. All have published a steady stream of anti-Jeremy Corbyn articles since he became leader in 2015, self-evidently prefering a "sensible" more "moderate" leader in the mould of Tony Blair. Even after the surprise Labour showing in the 2017 election, the paper refused to change tack, instead using Corbyn's perceived resistance to the remain "cause" and unwillingness to tackle anti-semitism in more extreme elements of the party as attack lines.

Unsurprisingly, the prefered tactics of a new Labour publication trying to _form_ the opinion of its readers include focus group findings and opinion polls. When I read on Saturday that [Voters' disillusionment renders expected election tough to call](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/26/voters-disillusionment-renders-expected-election-tough-to-call) (a finding based on the opinions of 16 people in Watford, incidentally) I donned my deerstalker and went Googling. Who was behind this "research"?
