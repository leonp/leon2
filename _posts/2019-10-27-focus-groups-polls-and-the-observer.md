Occasionally, I like to play amateur politics sleuth and, as they say, follow the money. I can claim some success in this. Back in 2015 I got The Guardian to change this story about [Labour voters deserting the party forever after the 2015 election because of a leftward shift](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/18/labour-party-voters-desertion-election) so it acknowledged the people behind the article's "research". It turned out they weren't entirely disinterested observers, or even researchers, for that matter. They were in fact former Tony Blair advisors.

<cite>The Observer</cite> is an overtly centrist publication, actively pushing for a change in the Labour party. Where The Guardian more or less objectively reports on politics and publishes a broad range of left-leaning columnists, The Observer sticks to its roster of New Labour giants, including Andrew Rawnsley, Will Hutton, Nick Cohen and Toby Helm. All have published a steady stream of anti-Jeremy Corbyn articles since he became leader in 2015, self-evidently prefering a "sensible" more "moderate" leader in the mould of Tony Blair. Even after the surprise Labour showing in the 2017 election, the paper refused to change tack, instead using Corbyn's perceived resistance to the remain "cause" and unwillingness to tackle anti-semitism in more extreme elements of the party as attack lines.

Unsurprisingly, the prefered tactics of a centrist publication trying to _form_ the opinion of its readers include focus group findings and opinion polls. When I read on Saturday that [Voters' disillusionment renders expected election tough to call](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/oct/26/voters-disillusionment-renders-expected-election-tough-to-call) (a finding based on the opinions of 16 people in Watford, incidentally) I donned my deerstalker and went Googling. Who was behind the "research" that led to this conclusion?

Once again, the company responsible for the findings - an an "international insight and strategy consultancy" called [BritainThinks](https://britainthinks.com/) - aren't really researchers. They're more interested in ["managing reputation, building a brand, or framing an issue"](https://britainthinks.com/what-we-do/strategy), or what we normally call _PR_. Two of its founders - [Ben Shimshom and Deborah Mattinson](https://britainthinks.com/team/) - worked for Gordon Brown back in the dog days of new Labour, [helping to produce general election campaign posters](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/poster-truth-politics-the-gordon-brown-posters-for-the-election-that-never-was), for example.

The article doesn't simply attack Jeremy Corbyn. Instead, it "frames" the election around voter disatisfaction with both main parties, and the whole political process. I was trying to figure out if - and how - this supports <cite>The Observer</cite>'s agenda. But then a Sunday article on a [Lib Dem attempt to force an early election](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/26/boris-johnson-no-brexit-until-january-block-christmas-general-election) made sense. According to this narrative, Labour and the Tories will do badly in an election, which will leave an opportunity for centrist parties such as the Liberal Democrats and SNP. As a bonus, Jeremy Corbyn will probably resign. It's a win win. Add a 16pt lead for the Tories opinion poll and a (particularly patronising) [Rawnsley piece on Labour and Tory fears of an election](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/27/turkeys-wont-vote-for-christmas-when-the-polls-are-telling-them-theyll-be-stuffed) and you have a Lib Dem-shaped strategy taking shape.
