This is [what it looks like](https://www.art.yale.edu/). It’s a mess. I get that. That’s the point. I am missing the point.

But this is fucking terrible, non?

Other things I get:

You want to rail against conformity. That all web design looks the same. That all web design is so tastefully minamalist. That you feel web design can be so righteously accessible. That writing “proper” markup is so worthy.

And wasn’t the web _fun_ before, when viewed from an ironic distance of, say, 20 years? When you didn’t have to bother with things like structure, readability and accessibility. Free expression! Look at that background image of a dog. Isn’t that funny? Wasn’t 11 pixel type cool?

I found the fees page in the end.

> Bills for tuition, room, and board are available during the first week of July, due and payable by August 1 for the fall term; and during the first week of November, due and payable by December 1 for the spring term. The Office of Student Financial Services will impose late fees of $125 per month (up to a total of $375 per term) if any part of the term bill, less Yale-administered loans and scholarships that have been applied for on a timely basis, is not paid when due. Nonpayment of bills and failure to complete and submit financial aid application packages on a timely basis may result in the student’s involuntary withdrawal from the University. <cite>[Tuition, fees, and cost of attendance](https://www.art.yale.edu/about/resources/financial-aid/tuition-fees-general-expenses)</cite>

Enjoyed the budgie on a tennis ball gif while reading this though.

So misconceived. The _real_ challenge would be to create a site that was both usable and expressed something new. It’s as rebellious as mashed potato.

## Buy ironic brutalist design!

[Nice work if you can get it](https://www.linkedbyair.net/).
