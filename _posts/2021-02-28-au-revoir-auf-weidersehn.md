As you may or may not have noticed, I havenâ€™t posted anything to this site in a while.

Thatâ€™s because `leonpaternoster.com` is really just a professional portfolio now.

I was lucky enough to be able to publish anything I liked here, but that doesnâ€™t really fit in with the work vibe, and hasnâ€™t for a while.

But! I do still blog at [This Dayâ€™s Portion](https://www.thisdaysportion.com). Here youâ€™ll find notes, links and posts on:

- Building and writing on the web
- Politics
- Books
- TV
- More personal stuff
- The odd photo (I am in no way a photgrapher, professional or amateur)

The frequency varies, with most posts coming at the weekend. In February I blogged 12 times, mostly 1-300 word efforts.

So if you are interested in subscribing head over to the [This Dayâ€™s Portion RSS feed](https://www.thisdaysportion.com/feed/index.xml) now.

Cheers! <span role="img" aria-label="Waving goodbye">ðŸ‘‹</span>
