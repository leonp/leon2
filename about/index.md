I'm Leon, head of digital and marketing at [Suffolk Libraries](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk). I've worked in digital and, to a lesser extent, IT, since 2008.

I live in [Ipswich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich), Suffolk in the UK. In my current role, I'm responsible for lots of things, including our website and apps we develop. Perhaps most interestingly, **I conceived and led the development of [Verso](https://dootrix.com/verso/), our own library self-service system**, a [progressive web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications) now sold by software developers [Dootrix](https://dootrix.com/) to other library services.

## What I do

My background is in **planning, building and running websites, apps and online marketing**. This has expanded to include all forms of marketing, on and offline -- I formulate and deliver digital and marketing strategies.

I've also got extensive experience of **managing complex digital projects**. I work with stakeholders, customers and agencies, balancing time and financial constraints. I normally work using an agile framework, and have facilitated several **design sprints**.

I've got some technical experience too:

- Simple, accessible web design that uses javascript defensively
- Focusing on performance and security, mainly through using [static websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page). I developed the Suffolk Libraries website using this method -- it was probably the first non-profit/governmental website of its type in the UK.
- Developing websites using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator
- Using the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating language
- Using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for fast and safe hosting, forms and automated site builds
- Using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for easy deployment and back-ups
- Using [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to create content management systems for non-technical editors

If appropriate, I can use WordPress or [Kirby](https://getkirby.com) to create sites that require a back end.

## Colophon

<p>This site is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static site</a> generator, and hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, who specialise in hosting static sites. Netlify connects to Git (well, Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket), which means that when I push a change to my repo, the website is updated. This is a very good way to work. I recommend Netlify &#8212; they also offer forms, redirects and even AWS services integration.</p>

<p>I use my own Jekyll &#8220;framework&#8221; called <a href="https://github.com/leonp/jekyll-tachyons">Jekyll Tachyons</a>, as it makes building a Jekyll site on the <a href="http://tachyons.io">Tachyons CSS framework</a> quick and easy. I like <span role="img" aria-label="lightning fast">⚡️</span>.</p>
