<div class="c-hyphens c-prose-h">

<p>I'm Leon, head of marketing and digital at Suffolk Libraries. I'm responsible for lots of things, including our website and apps we develop. Most interestingly, we made our own library self-service system, which is a progressive web app, and is now sold by software developers Dootrix to other library services.</p>

<p>I've worked in web and, to a lesser extent, IT, since 2008. Before that, I taught secondary English for a few years, and before that I worked as an <abbr title="Network Operations Centre">NOC</abbr> engineer for a telecoms company. My first jobs involved trying to flog ad space.</p>

<p>I've written a blog since 2008. Unsurprisingly, what I've written reflects whatever I've been interested in at the time. I don't just write about work. When I commuted to a job, I read a lot and kept a log of my reading here. Since 2010 I've been a Labour party member and fretted about the future of the party until Jeremy Corbyn became its leader. For a few years I was particularly interested in the idea of a Universal Basic Income. Sometimes I'll write about something that just grabs my attention. It's all here.</p>

<p>This site is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator, and hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, who specialise in hosting static sites. I recommend them. I use my own Jekyll "framework" called <a href="https://github.com/leonp/jekyll-tachyons">Jekyll Tachyons</a>, as it makes building a Jekyll site on the <a href="http://tachyons.io">Tachyons CSS framework</a> quick and easy. I like <span role="img" aria-label="lightning fast">⚡️</span>.</p>

<p>The body typeface at the time of writing is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif">IBM Plex Serif</a>, hosted locally but also available from Google Fonts. It's the best Georgia replacement I've found. Headings and ancillary text are set in Avenir or, if you're not on an Apple product, whatever your default sans serif is.</p>
