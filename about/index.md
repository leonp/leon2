<p>I'm Leon, web services manager at Suffolk Libraries. I'm responsible for lots of things, including our website and apps we develop. Most interestingly, I conceived and led the development of our own <a href="/posts/managing-self-service-project/">library self-service system</a>, a progressive web app now sold by software developers Dootrix to other library services.</p>

<p>I've worked in web and, to a lesser extent, IT, since 2008. Before that, I taught secondary English for a few years, and before that I worked as an <abbr title="Network Operations Centre">NOC</abbr> engineer for a telecoms company. My first jobs involved trying to flog ad space.</p>

<p>I've written a blog since 2008. Unsurprisingly, over the years what I've written about has changed, reflecting whatever I've been interested in at the time. I don't just write about work. When I commuted, I was lucky enough to have the time to read, and logged the books here. Since 2010 I've been a Labour party member and fretted about the future of the party, until Jeremy Corbyn became its leader. For a few years I was particularly interested in the idea of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">Universal Basic Income</a>. Sometimes I'll write about something that just grabs my attention. It's all here.</p>

<p>This site is built using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">static site</a> generator, and hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>, who specialise in hosting static sites. Netlify connects to Git (well, Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket), which means that when I push a change to my repo, the website is updated. This is a very good way to work. I recommend Netlify &#8212; they also offer forms, redirects and even AWS services integration.</p>

<p>I use my own Jekyll &#8220;framework&#8221; called <a href="https://github.com/leonp/jekyll-tachyons">Jekyll Tachyons</a>, as it makes building a Jekyll site on the <a href="http://tachyons.io">Tachyons CSS framework</a> quick and easy. I like <span role="img" aria-label="lightning fast">⚡️</span>.</p>
