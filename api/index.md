This site has a very simple, static <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> which enables you to access its content in <abbr title="JavaScript Object Natation">JSON</abbr>. The API is updated whenever I update the site.

The endpoint is:

**[https://www.leonpaternoster.com/api/posts.json](/api/posts.json)**

As to _why_ anyone might want to access this content, I'm not sure. Although it could be useful for me if I was shifting platform. It's more me testing something I might use elsewhere. Enjoy <span role="img" aria-label="Smiley face">üòÅ</span>.
