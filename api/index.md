This site has a very simple <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> which enables you to access its content in <abbr title="JavaScript Object Natation">JSON</abbr>.

There are three endpoints:

- [Posts](/api/posts.json)
- [Links](/api/links.json)
- [Notes](/api/notes.json)

As to _why_ anyone might want to access this content, I'm not sure. Although it could be useful for me if I was shifting platform. It's more me testing something I might use elsewhere. Enjoy <span role="img" aria-label="Smiley face">üòÅ</span>.
