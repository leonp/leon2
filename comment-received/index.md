Thanks, I appreciate you taking the time to respond.

## Commenting policy

I'm sure you were, but please be polite, even if you're being critical. I do reserve the right to not publish comments I deem inappropriate, offensive, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic etc. etc. If you think I'm being unreasonable, drop me an email at leon.paternoster@zoho.com
