I've received your comment and tucked it away. It's all good.

## What happens now?

At this moment in time I'm building a comment system. I'll have it up and running in a few days, when your comment will be revealed in all its glory.

<a id="back-link" href="#" rel="previous" onclick="document.getElementById( 'back-link' ).href = document.referrer">Back to the previous page ↩️</a>
