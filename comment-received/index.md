Thanks, I appreciate you taking the time to comment.

## What happens now?

I've received a notification and will review your comment. Assuming all's OK, you've kept to the commenting policy and you're not some dullard robot or unfortunate human trying to spam me, I'll publish it.

I'm working on setting up automated notifications so that when I approve your comment, you'll get an email. However, at the moment you'll just have to check back. Sorry about that. I aim to approve comments as soon as possible.

<a id="back-link" href="#" rel="previous" onclick="document.getElementById( 'back-link' ).href = document.referrer">Back to the previous page <span role="img" aria-label="Arrow pointing to the left">↩️</span></a>

## Commenting policy

I'm sure you were, but please be polite, even if you're being critical. I do reserve the right to remove any comments I deem inappropriate, offensive, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic etc. etc.
