## About

I'm head of digital and marketing at [Suffolk Libraries](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk). I developed [Verso](https://dootrix.com/verso/), a new, lightweight self-service system for libraries.

I've got ten years' experience of building and managing digital teams in the not-for-profit sector. I also make fast and friendly websites for small organisations.
