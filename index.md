I’m head of digital and marketing at [Suffolk Libraries](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk), an independent, not-for-profit that runs Suffolk’s library service. I conceived and developed [Verso](https://dootrix.com/verso/), a lightweight, modern, flexible self-service system. I’ve been blogging about the web, design and anything else that interests me since 2008.
