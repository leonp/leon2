I&apos;m Leon, head of digital and marketing at [Suffolk Libraries](https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk). I developed [Verso](https://dootrix.com/verso/), a new, lightweight self-service system for libraries.

I&apos;ve got ten years&apos; experience of building and managing digital teams in the not-for-profit sector. I also make fast and friendly websites for small organisations. Get in touch if you&apos;d like to discuss your project:
