<p class="c-linky-visited c-linky-underline">I’m head of digital and marketing at <a href="https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk">Suffolk Libraries</a>, an independent, not-for-profit that runs Suffolk’s library service. I conceived and developed <a href="https://dootrix.com/verso/">Verso</a>, a lightweight, modern, flexible self-service system. I’ve been blogging about the web, design and anything else that interests me since 2008.</p>
