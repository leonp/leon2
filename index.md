I'm Leon, web services manager at Suffolk Libraries. Since 2008 I've written about working on the web, covering topics such as usability, accessibility, libraries (as in the real buildings, not a set of pre-written classes, scripts and data) and developing web products and services. I'm also interested in politics, books, music, philosophy and history. You have been warned.
