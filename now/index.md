So, a Now page. Last updated Sun 23 June 2019. Apologies if that's not very now.

- About to list all library services and then map them against a MIND taxonomy, in preparation for&hellip;
- Thinking about design agencies that feel local in their scope. That's not a good thing, IMO.
- Still thinking about inflicting less meetings on my team at work.
- Looking at hooking up my site with Firebase for comments.
- Thinking about how I would define the webdev bit of what I do (front end, HTML and CSS and that's all), and how useful that is to me and the outside world.
- Still thinking that regularly updating a now page is actually just old-fashioned blogging in its purest sense, only you delete all but the most recent post.
