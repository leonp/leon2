So, a Now page. Last updated Tue 4 June 2019. Apologies if that's not very now.

- Considering a work "library people" podcast, wary that no-one will listen, wondering who might listen and that it's a lot of work to produce and promote. But it would be _a good thing_ should it take off in some way.
- Heading to Birmingham on Friday to present [Verso self-service](https://dootrix.com/verso/). Driving there and back on the same day.
- Thinking about inflicting less meetings on my team at work.
- Looking forward to my daughter returning home on Friday from a five day residential trip with her school.
- Still thinking that regularly updating a now page is actually just old-fashioned blogging in its purest sense, only you delete all but the most recent post.
