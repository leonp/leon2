So, a Now page. Last updated Sat 25 May 2019. Apologies if that's not very now.

- Adding [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to my site so I get a nice, web-based front end for adding content. It works! It handles Jekyll collections and posts with aplomb. Here's the [admin config file](https://github.com/leonp/leon2/blob/master/admin/config.yml).
- Changing what I post to this site. No 500+ word blogs for a few months now, enjoy [links](/links) and [notes](/notes) instead.
- Trying to use Twitter less. Complicated reasons. At the same time going fairly [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/why) by writing here first and automatically pushing to Twitter (with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)). Worried that indieweb is maybe just an old bloke's thing (for [DOWFs, as Bruce Lawson calls them/us](https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2019/structured-data-and-google/)).
- Assembling my son's new bed this weekend.
- Getting ready for the [Suffolk Show](https://suffolkshow.co.uk/) next week at work.
- Grappling with branding a library service. Or: how to make books a sub-brand in order to solve the "more than just books" conundrum.
- Thinking that regularly updating a now page is actually just old-fashioned blogging in its purest sense, only you delete all but the most recent post. One page blogs.
